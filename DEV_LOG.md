# Developer Log & Scratchpad

> **Purpose**: Use this file to store temporary drafts, brainstorm ideas, log session outputs, and keep track of decisions. This prevents cluttering the main `PROJECT_MEMORY.md` with ephemeral data.

## Session: 2026-02-09 [Restructuring]

### Log
- Analyzed existing documentation structure.
- User approved 4-File System: `USER_PROMPTS.md`, `PLAN.md`, `DEV_LOG.md`, `PROJECT_MEMORY.md`.
- Consolidated `SYSTEM.md` and `PROMPTS.md` into `PROJECT_MEMORY.md`.
- Created `USER_PROMPTS.md` for dedicated input.
- Re-created clean `PLAN.md`.

### Next Steps
- Implement `ASS` subtitle rendering (Top Priority).
- Verify VRAM usage with new workflow.
