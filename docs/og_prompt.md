The Original Prompt that started it all:

Requirement:
``` I wanna scale it with the features. I need your analysis. Should I focus on all the features at once? Or should I first write the basic code and verify the core, basic functionality, then glue it piece by piece, and then when all works, make a final product, ready to use, only by me, for my specific hardware, no one else. ```

Hardware Details:
```
Device: Lenovo LOQ Gaming Laptop

CPU: AMD Ryzen 7 7435HS | Speed: 3.1GHz (Base) - 4.5GHz (Max) | 8 Cores | 16 Threads | 16MB Cache | (no iGPU)
GPU: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4060 8GB GDDR6, Boost Clock 2370MHz, TGP 105W | (TDP upto 135W)
RAM: 24GB (2x12GB SO-DIMM DDR5-4800)
ROM: 512GB SSD M.2 2242 PCIe 4.0x4 NVMe

External SSD: 440GB --> which I'll use to store/install the AI Software.

```

The user should be able to either share a youtube link and the software auto downloads the video from youtube using yt-dlp, or the user can share a pre-downloaded video as well. It should be able to detect both types of formats.

The software should let the user 'co-pilot' which means -> the user should be able to modify the caption styles, color, the placement, format, font style, caption animation presets (choose from the given formats).

The software should be smart enough to auto detect the duration of the shorts like, for eg -> 
user uploads a 10 minutes video.
the software auto detects the hook, script, the emotions etc. and let's the user know that from this 10 minutes video -> 
4-5 shorts can be made of the given duration seconds, minute. some pre-made/default presets like -> 30sec, 45sec, 60sec, or let the user decide the duration based on the shorts content. It should be configurable that's what i mean to say.
Depending upon the user's desired length, the total number of shorts might exceed the 4-5 limit or decrease.

The software/AI should have these mandatory:
```
 AI-Powered Clip Detection:

	-> Engagement Ranking: analyzes peaks, hooks, and emotional scenes to find what actually goes viral. (very very important/crucial, without it, no use of executing this project)

	-> Smart Transitions: Seamless cuts that keep viewers watching.

	-> Auto-Crop: Keeps the action centered in the 9:16 frame automatically.

 Professional Captions (Built-In):

 	Stop using external caption apps. Get 5 stunning, "Alex Hormozi" style presets

	-> Styles: Bold Shadow, Outline Glow, Gradient Vibrant, Glass Morphism, Minimal Elegant.

	-> Total Control: Drag-and-drop positioning, font sizes (16-120px), and auto-burn embedding.

```

How It Works (5-Minute Workflow) -> ``` this is copied from the ViralClip AI ```

1.Paste: Drop any public YouTube URL into the app.

2.Analyze: AI identifies 3-5 viral moments in under 3 minutes.

3.Customize: Choose your caption style and position.

4.Generate: Render professional 1080x1920 (9:16) shorts.

5.Post: Download your watermark-free video and go viral.

The user want's the AI to research the internet for the best models, that fit in with the hardware and are better than the current ones.

Also, the user wants the AI Agent to keep this as the main check-list for the development of this app.
